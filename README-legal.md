- resources/ (graphics from MMapper)      is GPLv2 by the MMapper authors, and
  causes Play MUME! to use GPLv2 instead of GPLv3.
- libs/jquery-3.2.1.js                    is MIT-licensed.

The map data found in the releases has a unspecified license:
- The included room names and descs are certainly NOT free and belong to the
  MUME authors.
- The map itself is maintained by Waba, based on an early arda.mm2 bundled with
  MMapper. That's probably GPLv2-licensed.
