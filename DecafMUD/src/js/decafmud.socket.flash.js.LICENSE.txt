 * DecafMUD v0.9.0
 * http://decafmud.stendec.me
 *
 * Socket: Flash
 *
 * This allows DecafMUD to connect with sockets provided by the Adobe Flash
 * plugin. This works well on most platforms (OS X, Windows, and Linux) as
 * long as they have an up-to-date version of Flash.
 *
 * It, however, won't work on some mobile devices, such as Apple iDevices, and
 * requires a policy daemon to be running on the remote server.
